# Changes made to the design of the application as a whole
1. From feedback, I changed the concept design to be more general, not specifically about fanfiction.

# 5-10 pointers to interesting moments (explained below) in your development, each with a couple of sentences explaining it.
Interesting moments. As you work on your implementation, some moments will be worth recording. For example, you might discover that your concept specification was wrong in some way; a test run might expose a subtle bug in a concept implementation; the LLM might generate some code that is unexpectedly good or bad in some way; you might discover a way to simplify your design; and so on. When any such moment arises, you should save a link to the relevant file and place it in your design document. Make sure to save a link to a snapshot in the context area, not a link to a file in the design or source code areas (since those are mutable). If this moment did not arise from running the LLM, you should save the relevant files by creating a little design document to record your observations, and then run the tool with the save option to snapshot the files first.
