```
<template>
  <div class="about">
    <h1>This is an about page</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<style>
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .about {
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
</style>

```

Each version contains a fic, where each fic is a new version.
An Example:
VersionA title = "My Fanfic"
and it contains Fics: "MyFanfic version 1", "version 2", "version 3"

The website works great already, but I fear there is no button to add versions, nor is there buttons to resumbit fanfics, nor is there buttons to delete user, fanfics, or entire versions.
