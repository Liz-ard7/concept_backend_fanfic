# response:

You're on the right track by checking the developer tools! When something "fails to bring up anything," it often means an API call either failed, or returned an unexpected (e.g., empty) result, which the frontend then doesn't know how to render.

Given our previous fix involved a backend query not adhering to the `array of objects` rule for queries, let's systematically debug this. The `_viewFic` endpoint is indeed a query, and we should verify its behavior.

Here's how to debug this effectively using your browser's developer tools:

**1. Open Browser Developer Tools:**

* In Chrome: Right-click anywhere on your page and select "Inspect", or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Option+I` (macOS).
* In Firefox: Right-click and select "Inspect Element", or `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`.

**2. Navigate to the Network Tab:**

* Within the developer tools panel, find and click on the "Network" tab.
* Keep this tab open and clear any existing network requests if there are many.

**3. Trigger the `_viewFic` Action:**

* Go to your Vue.js frontend in the browser.
* Log in with a user.
* Submit a new fic (if you don't have one already).
* Click the "View Details" button next to one of your fics.

**4. Inspect the Network Request:**

* In the "Network" tab, you should see a new `POST` request appear, likely to `/api/Library/_viewFic`.
* Click on this request to view its details.

**5. Check Request and Response:**

* **Headers Tab:**
  \*   Verify the "Request URL" is correct: `http://localhost:8000/api/Library/_viewFic`.
  \*   Verify the "Request Method" is `POST`.
  \*   Verify "Content-Type" is `application/json`.

* **Payload Tab:**
  \*   This shows what your frontend sent to the backend. It should look something like:
  ```json
  {
    "user": "user:YOUR_USER_ID",
    "ficName": "Your Fic Title",
    "versionNumber": 0
  }
  ```

```
  *   **Crucially, verify that `user`, `ficName`, and `versionNumber` are the exact values you expect and that they match the data stored in your MongoDB.** (Case sensitivity, leading/trailing spaces, etc., can cause mismatches).
```

* **Response Tab (or Preview Tab):**
  \*   **This is the most important part.** What does the backend actually send back?
  \*   **Scenario A: Success.** You should see an array containing an object like this:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "fic": {
        "_id": "fic:some_id",
        "name": "Your Fic Title",
        "text": "The content of your fic...",
        "authorTags": "tag1\ntag2",
        "date": { "day": 1, "month": 1, "year": 2023 },
        "versionNumber": 0
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
  If you see this, the backend is working correctly, and the issue might be a frontend reactivity or rendering problem.
  \*   **Scenario B: Error.** You will likely see an object like this:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "A descriptive error message."
  }
  ```
  **If you get an error, what is the exact error message?** This will tell us *why* the backend `_viewFic` method failed. Common errors from your backend might be:
  * `User '...' does not exist.` (If the user ID isn't found).
  * `Fic with name '...' does not exist for user '...'.` (If the title doesn't match).
  * `Version number '...' is out of range for fic '...'.` (If the `versionNumber` is incorrect).
  * `Fic revision with version number '...' not found for '...'.` (If the specific fic revision isn't found).

* **Console Tab:**
  \*   Check for any `console.error` messages originating from your frontend code, specifically from the `viewFicDetails` function's `if ('error' in result)` block. This should `alert` the error message from the backend.

***

**Based on the problem description, I suspect one of two things:**

1. **A backend error is being returned.** The frontend code for `viewFicDetails` *does* have an `alert` for errors (`alert('Error viewing fic: ' + result.error);`). If you're not seeing this alert, it might be that the error message is generic, or the alert is dismissed quickly, or there's a subtle issue preventing the alert itself from firing. The **Network tab's Response body** will be definitive here.
2. **The backend is returning success, but `result.fic` is `null` or `undefined`** (less likely given how your backend `_viewFic` is implemented to return a full object on success).

Let's proceed once you've inspected the network request and determined the exact response from the `_viewFic` endpoint.

**If you find an error in the Response tab, copy and paste it here.** That will tell us exactly what needs to be adjusted!
