# I 100% see "Deno concept server running on http://localhost:8000". Since UserAuthentication is what isn't working, I think it might be an issue with that? Rather, what uses UserAuthentication. We (context and I) have both done testing on all of the concepts, so I think that is good. Also, username and password (the strings) are hard to see against the background. How should we fix it?
