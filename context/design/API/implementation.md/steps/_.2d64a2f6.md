# Great!! Totally works now. Except, when I look at the details of the Fic, it doesn't bring up the categorizing suggestedTags & tagsToRemove! When a fic is submitted, I would like it so that Categorizing automatically generates tags for it and then when you click "view details" the suggested tags show up there.
