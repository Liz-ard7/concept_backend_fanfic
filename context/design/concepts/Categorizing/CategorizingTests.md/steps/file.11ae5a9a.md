Do NOT define new concepts and do NOT create implementations. The only thing you should do is testing the Categorizing Implementation from implementation.md.

Be as short and concise as possible, as the prompt for the AI of this concept requires a lot of tokens that hit the max very quickly.
Have as FEW CALLS to categorizeFic as possible.

DO NOT Test upon the output of the AI, like seeing if suggested tags includes specific things. It is too underdetermined to test upon.
