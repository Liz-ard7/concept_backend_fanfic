# Syncing

Our goal is to decide which addresses should be included (that is, passed through directly) and which should be excluded (that is, turned into request actions for syncing) for the backend and frontend, but how do I choose which ones for which? I recall from lecture that the ones that I want people to be able to run should be the ones that are passed through directly, is that correct? If so, can you elaborate?
